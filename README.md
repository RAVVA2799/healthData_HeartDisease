This project analyzes a dataset related to heart disease to uncover patterns and insights that could help in early detection and prevention. Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning, we examine key risk factors and build predictive models.

**📂 Dataset**

Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oktayrdeki/heart-disease

Description: The dataset contains multiple features related to patient health indicators (e.g., cholesterol, blood pressure, heart rate) and a target variable indicating heart disease presence.

**🛠 Tech Stack**

Programming Language: Python 🐍

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn

**🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Handling missing values and outliers

Feature distributions and correlations

Visualizing relationships between risk factors and heart disease

**🤖 Machine Learning Model**

Algorithms Used: K-Means, Logistic Regression, LabelEncoder , LinearRegression

Model Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

**📊 Key Findings**

1. High cholesterol levels significantly correlate with heart disease .
2. Smokingf and Alcohol Consumption also leads to heart Disease .(See the Pie Chart visualization)
3. Stress Level is aslo directly proprtional to the Various Health parameters .(Plotted Clustering Graph)
